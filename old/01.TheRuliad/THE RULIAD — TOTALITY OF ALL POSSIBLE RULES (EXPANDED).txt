1)  THE RULIAD — TOTALITY OF ALL POSSIBLE RULES
============================================================

1.1)  DEFINITION
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    The Ruliad is the complete space of all possible rules acting on
    all possible states. Every conceivable computation, transformation,
    or relation already exists within it.

1.2)  TIMELESSNESS
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    The Ruliad does not unfold in sequence — it is not an evolving
    process. All possible updates and outcomes coexist simultaneously.
    There is no preferred order, direction, or measure of progression.

1.3)  ABSOLUTE COMPLETENESS
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    Because it includes all rules, the Ruliad already contains every
    possible state they can produce. No configuration lies outside it,
    because “outside” would imply a new rule, which is already within
    its set.

1.4)  UNDIFFERENTIATED TOTALITY
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    With all possibilities equally present, the Ruliad lacks internal
    contrast. Every rule, outcome, and transformation is equally real
    and equally valid — forming a perfectly uniform field of logical
    possibility.

1.5)  SELF-CONTAINMENT
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    There is no external reference, no boundary, no observer beyond it.
    Any attempt to define something beyond the Ruliad would itself be
    another rule, therefore already included inside it.

1.6)  IMPLICATION
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    In this state of infinite simultaneity, no differentiation,
    direction, or structure yet exists. All potential states coexist
    without hierarchy or relation.

→  To move from this undifferentiated totality toward definable
    existence, internal contrast must emerge — leading naturally
    into Point 2: **Infinite Computation ⇒ No Ordering**.
