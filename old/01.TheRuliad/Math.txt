1)  MATHEMATICAL FORMALIZATION OF THE RULIAD
============================================================

1.1)  BASE DEFINITIONS
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    Let:

        S  =  set of all possible states
        R  =  set of all possible rules (transformations) acting on S

    Each rule  r ∈ R  is a function:

        r : S → S

    (mapping one possible state to another possible state)

    The Ruliad, denoted  ℛ , is defined as:

        ℛ  =  { (r, s) | r ∈ R, s ∈ S, and r(s) ∈ S }

    →  ℛ  is the total relational closure of all possible rules acting on
        all possible states — the complete logical space of rule–state pairs.

1.2)  CLOSURE & COMPLETENESS
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    For every possible function  f : S → S ,  f ∈ R .
    Therefore, ℛ is closed under rule composition:

        ∀ r₁, r₂ ∈ R : (r₂ ∘ r₁) ∈ R

    and under state evolution:

        ∀ s ∈ S, r ∈ R : r(s) ∈ S

    Hence, ℛ is self-complete:

        ℛ = closure( R × S ) under composition and state transition

1.3)  TIMELESSNESS
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    Because all (r, s, r(s)) triples coexist simultaneously, there is no
    preferred temporal ordering.  Formally:

        ∄ T : ℛ → ℝ   such that T(r₁,s₁) < T(r₂,s₂)   defines global time.

    The Ruliad has no intrinsic partial order in time; ordering will later
    *emerge* from internal relational consistency.

1.4)  NON-DISTINGUISHABILITY
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    For all (rᵢ, sᵢ), (rⱼ, sⱼ) ∈ ℛ :

        (rᵢ, sᵢ) ≡ (rⱼ, sⱼ)   in absence of differentiating relations.

    That is, before any distinctions arise, all rule–state pairs are
    indistinguishable — forming a uniform, structureless set.

1.5)  SELF-CONTAINMENT
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    The Ruliad is definitionally total:

        ∄ x ∉ ℛ

    because any element x describable by a rule or state relation
    is already included within R × S.

1.6)  SUMMARIZED FORM
    ------------------------------------------------------------
        ℛ = closure( R × S )  
            where R = { all possible transformations on S },
                  S = { all possible distinguishable states }.

        ⇒ ℛ  is the complete, timeless, self-contained logical field
           of all possible rule–state interactions.

→  From this definition, no ordering or structure yet exists.
    Differentiation (contrast between members of ℛ) must emerge
    internally — leading naturally into Point 2:
    **Infinite Computation ⇒ No Ordering.**
