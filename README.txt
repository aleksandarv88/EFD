EFD — Emergent Feedback Dynamics
======================================================

Author: Aleksandar Volchev  
Folder root: (this directory)  
Main docs: ./docs/

EFD (Emergent Feedback Dynamics) is a top-down framework that
starts from a minimal logical loop

    (nothing ↔ possibility)

and builds up:

    difference (Δ) → substrate (Ω) → emergence → physics → mind.

This repository contains:

  - foundational theory (logic + math)
  - ontological emergence principle
  - hierarchy of levels (ontology → physics → mind)
  - numerical simulations (onset of dynamics, curvature, etc.)

Each subfolder has its own README.txt explaining its contents.

HOW TO READ THIS PROJECT
======================================================

1. Start with:
      docs/README.txt

2. Then follow the reading order given there (foundations first).

3. For any chapter that has simulations:
      docs/{chapter_name}/sims/README.txt
   will explain how sims are organized.

4. For a specific simulation:
      docs/{chapter_name}/sims/{sim_name}/README.txt
   will tell you what the sim does and how to interpret results.

5. For a specific AI version of a sim:
      docs/{chapter_name}/sims/{sim_name}/{ai_name}/README.txt
   will show config, media, and code details for that AI run.

======================================================
FOR MAINTAINERS / PROJECT STRUCTURE
======================================================

The abstract folder and naming scheme for chapters, docs,
and simulations is described in:

    docs/FolderStructure_Spec.txt

If you add new chapters, simulations, or AI-specific runs,
follow that spec (or update it first, then regenerate).
