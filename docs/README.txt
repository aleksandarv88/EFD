======================================================

This folder contains all conceptual documents and
simulation subfolders for EFD (Emergent Feedback Dynamics).

High-level chapters currently:

  - foundations/          → ontology, math, emergence, hierarchy
  - onset_of_dynamics/    → early geometry and dynamics sims
  - (future) physics/     → mapping to QM, QFT, GR, Newton
  - (future) mind/        → observers, consciousness, self-loops

======================================================
RECOMMENDED READING ORDER
======================================================

1. foundations/
   - Start here. See:
       docs/foundations/README.txt

2. onset_of_dynamics/
   - For how geometry and curvature emerge.
   - See:
       docs/onset_of_dynamics/README.txt

3. (future) physics/
   - How standard physics appears as emergent description.

4. (future) mind/
   - How observers and consciousness appear as loop structures.

Each chapter folder has its own README.txt that explains:

  - what that chapter covers,
  - which .txt docs to read first,
  - how any sims are organized.
