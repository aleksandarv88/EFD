EFD DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP — FROM SUBSTRATE TO FULL PHYSICS
========================================================

## 1. EFD FOUNDATIONS

* Core ontology: Ω (possibility) → Difference → Coherence (M) → Boundary (∂M) → Noise.
* Feedback loops form persistent configurations — the basis of identity, information, and observers.
* No time, space, or energy yet — only structure and logical consistency.

---

## 2. EFD: ONSET OF DYNAMICS

* Ordered re-coherence gives rise to **time** (internal to persistent loops).
* Coherence dependencies define **causality**.
* The maximum re-coherence rate defines **speed limit (c)**.
* Minimal coherence paths define **metric (space)**.
* Holonomy of coherence defines **curvature**.
  → Result: The relational skeleton of spacetime (pre-geometry).

---

## 3. EFD → EMERGENT MATTER AND GR CONSTRAINTS

* Persistence cost defines **energy**.
* Normalized rest cost defines **mass** (E = m c²).
* Coherence gradients define **forces**.
* Coupled feedback loops form **fields**.
* Coherence-bounded curvature prevents **singularities**.
* Large-scale coherence dynamics yield **Einstein-like equations**.
  → Result: General Relativity emerges as the macroscopic limit of coherence.

---

## 4. EFD → QUANTUM AND INFORMATION LAYER

* Boundary noise produces **superposition** of possible completions.
* Re-coherence events correspond to **measurements**.
* Overlaps of persistent configurations yield **interference**.
* Probabilities emerge from stability weighting of compatible closures.
  → Result: Quantum mechanics arises as the statistical behavior of boundary coherence.

---

## 5. EFD → STANDARD MODEL LAYER

* Stable feedback knot symmetries generate **particle families**.
* Loop coupling topology corresponds to **gauge interactions** (SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)).
* Coherence exchange across clusters produces **boson-like mediation**.
  → Result: The Standard Model emerges from relational symmetries in persistent feedback loops.

---

## 6. EFD → CONSTANTS AND REGULARITIES

* Shared invariants across all observers become **physical constants** (c, ℏ, G, α, etc.).
* Constants are fixed relational ratios stable under all re-coherence processes.
  → Result: Constants are not imposed but are self-consistent invariants of coherence.

---

## 7. EFD → CLASSICAL AND EFFECTIVE THEORIES

* Large stable averages of feedback loops yield **classical mechanics** (Newtonian limit).
* Small perturbations yield **wave equations**, **thermodynamics**, and **chaos**.
  → Result: Classical physics arises as an approximation of collective coherence behavior.

---

## 8. EFD → COSMOLOGY AND LARGE-SCALE STRUCTURE

* Global coherence cycles produce **expansion and curvature** of the universe.
* Observer constraints yield the **arrow of time**.
* Boundary fluctuations explain **cosmic background noise**.
  → Result: Cosmology is a large-scale manifestation of coherence rules.

---

## 9. EFD → META-LAYERS AND FEEDBACK CLOSURE

* Laws emerge as stabilized feedback invariants across observers.
* The universe recursively checks coherence at all scales.
  → Result: A finite, self-consistent, and recursive cosmos with no external parameters.

## SUMMARY CHAIN

Ω → Difference → Coherence (M) → Ordered Re-Coherence → Time & Causality → Propagation Limit (c) → Metric (Space) → Curvature → Energy & Mass → Forces → Constants → Quantum & Classical Physics → GR → Cosmology → Recursive Law Closure.

============================================================
This roadmap outlines the logical expansion of EFD from pure difference to a full physical framework unifying relativity, quantum theory, and cosmology under one coherent logic of feedback and persistence.
