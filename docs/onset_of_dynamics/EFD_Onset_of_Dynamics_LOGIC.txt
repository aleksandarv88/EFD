EFD: ONSET OF DYNAMICS (Full Development)
=========================================

## 1. Starting Point

There is a substrate of admissible differences (Ω).

Consistency pressure selects a maximally coherent region **M**.

**M** has a boundary **∂M** where multiple admissible but incompatible extensions exist (noise = boundary non-invariance).

Inside **M**, some relations reference themselves and stay coherent: **feedback loops L**.

Any loop (or cluster of loops) induces its minimal coherence closure **Mₗ**.

Coupling glues several loops into a joint closure when they share constraints.

An observer is such a loop-cluster with a finite interface to its boundary.

This is all inherited from the existing EFD Foundations.

---

## 2. Emergent Sequence (Internal Time)

A loop-cluster cannot satisfy all boundary choices at once.

Therefore, it must re-apply its coherence checks in a specific order.

This ordered re-coherence sequence defines a temporal structure for that cluster.

Call this ordered sequence the **observer’s time**.

Time is thus **internal** to the cluster, not global in Ω.

---

## 3. Emergent Causal Structure

A change at one interface element can require re-coherence at another.

If re-coherence at **A** is always performed before **B**, then **A** influences **B** in that order.

Define **A → B** (A precedes B) if B’s coherence assignment depends on A’s assignment within the cluster’s sequence.

The set of such precedences inside **Mₗ** is the **causal structure** for that loop-cluster.

Causality here means: “must be settled first so the other can be settled.”

---

## 4. Emergent Speed Limit (c)

Re-coherence does not occur everywhere at once; it propagates along relations defining **Mₗ**.

There exists a shortest possible number of steps (or smallest coherence cost) for a change at point **X** to become required at point **Y**.

This defines a minimum re-coherence time per unit connection (or "hop") in the structure.

The inverse of this minimum is the maximum propagation rate of constraint changes.

Call this maximum rate **c** for that observer.

**c** is not imposed externally; it is fixed by the structure of **Mₗ** and its update rule.

---

## 5. Paths and Effective Metric

Between two interface points, there can be multiple re-coherence routes.

Each route has a total coherence cost (or total number of ordered steps).

The route with minimal cost is the **effective straight path** between those points.

Define the **distance** between two points as the minimal cost of re-coherence between them.

This makes distance an **emergent property** of the coherence structure, not a background assumption.

Collections of such distances define an **effective metric** for the observer.

---

## 6. Curvature (Holonomy of Re-Coherence)

Consider re-cohering around a small closed cycle in **Mₗ**.

If, after completing the cycle, the assignments differ from the starting state, a mismatch exists.

This mismatch comes from overlaps of constraints and is the **holonomy** of the cycle.

Non-zero holonomy means the effective metric is not globally flat — there is **curvature**.

Thus, curvature = “re-coherence around a loop does not return you to the same assignment.”

---

## 7. Coherence Cost and Energy

Every persistent loop or cluster must keep certain assignments coherent despite boundary flicker.

Maintaining these assignments incurs a non-zero **coherence cost**.

This stable, required cost is the loop’s **rest energy (E₀)**.

Because the underlying rule is uniform throughout **Mₗ**, the total coherence cost is conserved under re-coherence.

Conservation of coherence cost is the EFD analog of **energy conservation**.

---

## Transition to Next Layer: EFD → Emergent Physical Structures

At this point, the system exhibits all minimal prerequisites for a dynamic world:

* **Time** (ordered re-coherence)
* **Causality** (precedence of dependencies)
* **Speed limit c** (maximum propagation rate)
* **Space/metric** (minimal coherence paths)
* **Curvature** (holonomy mismatch)
* **Energy** (conserved coherence cost)

The following physical concepts — **mass**, **E = m c²**, **forces**, **constants**, and **singularity avoidance** — depend on these dynamics and therefore belong to the next phase:

> **EFD: Emergent Physical Structures**
> Where coherence cost, coupling, and bounded closure produce matter, motion, and physical law.
