TITLE: EFD HIERARCHY — LEVELS OF REALITY IN EFD

Goal:
  Provide a clean, layered map of EFD:
    from pure logic → substrate → emergence → physics → mind.

Hierarchy is top-down:
  EFD does not derive from physics,
  physics emerges as a mid-level shadow of EFD.

------------------------------------------------------
0. OVERVIEW DIAGRAM
------------------------------------------------------

Very high-level:

  LEVEL 0: Logical Ontology
      (nothing ↔ possibility) → Δ → closure

  LEVEL 1: Substrate Structure
      Ω (superposition of all possibilities)
      M (manifest slice)
      ∂M (boundary)
      η (noise)
      stable loops

  LEVEL 2: Emergence Principle
      F(L) = S(L) − λ η(L)
      high-F loops persist and scaffold

  LEVEL 3: Proto-Physics / Geometry
      topology of loops
      metric/curvature emergence
      conservation patterns

  LEVEL 4: Effective Physics
      QM, QFT, GR, Newtonian mechanics
      observers as stable loops

  LEVEL 5: Mind / Consciousness / Culture
      self-referential observer-of-observer loops
      information, meaning, theory-building

------------------------------------------------------
1. LEVEL 0 — LOGICAL ONTOLOGY
------------------------------------------------------

Core question:
  How do we get "something" without assuming it?

Objects:
  - primal loop: (nothing ↔ possibility)
  - difference operator: Δ
  - recursive closure of Δ

Outcome:
  - non-emptiness of P derived (not assumed)
  - minimal structure for "distinguishability"

Linked doc:
  - EFD_FOUNDATIONS_LOGIC_2.3.txt (sections 0–4)
  - EFD_FOUNDATIONS_MATH2.2.txt (sections 0–4)

Interpretation:
  This level is pre-physical. It sets up the logical conditions
  under which "anything at all" can be spoken about.

------------------------------------------------------
2. LEVEL 1 — SUBSTRATE STRUCTURE
------------------------------------------------------

Core question:
  Once difference is closed, what kind of "space" do we get?

Objects:
  - Ω : static closure of Δ, interpreted as superposition of all possibilities
  - M : manifest slice (coherent traversal of Ω)
  - ∂M : boundary between reconciled and unreconciled structures
  - η : noise as unresolved Δ at ∂M
  - stable feedback loops: L with Δ(L) ≈ L

Outcome:
  - a timeless substrate (Ω) with all possibilities present
  - local "worlds" M emerge as partial, coherent navigations of Ω
  - noise (η) prevents trivial collapse into tautology

Linked doc:
  - EFD_FOUNDATIONS_LOGIC_2.3.txt (sections 5–8)
  - EFD_FOUNDATIONS_MATH2.2.txt (sections 5–8)

Interpretation:
  This level defines the raw "field of possibilities" and the idea
  that laws/objects/observers are stable loops in this field.

------------------------------------------------------
3. LEVEL 2 — EMERGENCE PRINCIPLE
------------------------------------------------------

Core question:
  Out of all logically allowed configurations, which ones persist?

Objects:
  - stability S(L): how much a loop maps into itself
  - noise η(L): mismatch at the loop's boundary
  - emergence functional:
        F(L) = S(L) − λ η(L)

EFD Emergence Principle:
  Structures that score high on F(L) (high stability, low boundary noise)
  are the ones that actually persist and scaffold higher complexity.

Outcome:
  - selection of "real" structures from Ω
  - basis for why we see robust laws and objects instead of arbitrary chaos

Linked doc:
  - EFD_EMERGENCE_1.0.txt

Interpretation:
  This is not a physical variational principle.
  It is an ontological selection rule: what can consistently exist.

------------------------------------------------------
4. LEVEL 3 — PROTO-PHYSICS / GEOMETRY
------------------------------------------------------

Core question:
  How do recognizable physical structures (metric, curvature, fields)
  arise from stable loops?

Objects:
  - graph / hypergraph representations of Ω and loops
  - angle defects, curvature measures
  - continuity / refinement limits
  - conserved patterns under loop-dynamics

Outcome:
  - discrete curvature approximates smooth curvature
  - stable loop networks exhibit proto-metric and proto-topology
  - "space" and "geometry" appear as large-scale behavior of loops

Linked docs / code:
  - docs/onset_of_dynamics/*
  - curvature and continuum-limit sims
  - logs showing convergence (e.g. L2 error vs h)

Interpretation:
  This is where the substrate starts to "look" like something familiar:
  planes, spheres, saddles, curvature, and eventually spacetime.

------------------------------------------------------
5. LEVEL 4 — EFFECTIVE PHYSICS
------------------------------------------------------

Core question:
  How do standard physical theories emerge as approximations
  to the loop dynamics?

Objects:
  - QM / wavefunction:
        relational superposition of embeddings of stable loops
  - QFT:
        excitations on structured connectivity patterns
  - GR:
        large-scale curvature of stable networks
  - Newtonian mechanics:
        low-speed, weak-curvature limit of stable trajectories

Outcome:
  - Schrödinger equation: linear evolution when C ("connectivity") is fixed
  - Einstein equations: geometry-only evolution in high-stability regimes
  - conservation laws as algebraic shadows of Δ(L) ≈ L

Linked doc / future:
  - EFD_PHYSICS_MAP (to be written)
  - notes on:
        (ψ, C, S) master evolution,
        emergent limits → QM, QFT, GR, Newton

Interpretation:
  Physics is a mid-level, coarse-grained language describing
  how high-F(L) loops behave when viewed from inside M.

------------------------------------------------------
6. LEVEL 5 — MIND / CONSCIOUSNESS / CULTURE
------------------------------------------------------

Core question:
  How do observers, self-models, and meaning arise from loops?

Objects:
  - observer-loop L₁:
        stable boundary with inputs/outputs (world ↔ inside)
  - consciousness-loop L₂:
        loop that models L₁ and includes itself in the model
  - higher-order loops:
        language, science, EFD itself as feedback structures

Outcome:
  - proto-consciousness:
        minimal self-closed observer with tiny boundary
  - human-like consciousness:
        dense, deep loop hierarchies with rich world-models
  - culture/theory:
        loops operating over many minds and artifacts

Linked doc / future:
  - EFD_MIND_*.txt (to be defined later)

Interpretation:
  Mind is not an add-on to physics.
  It is a particular configuration of high-level loops within Ω, 
  capable of representing and modifying other loops, including itself.

------------------------------------------------------
7. FLOW (TOP-DOWN AND BOTTOM-UP)
------------------------------------------------------

Top-down (conceptual dependency):

  Level 0 → Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3 → Level 4 → Level 5
  (logic)  (substrate)  (emergence)  (proto-physics)  (physics)  (mind)

Bottom-up (what we empirically see):

  We start at Level 4–5 (physics, minds),
  then infer Level 3 (proto-geometry, loops),
  then Level 2 (emergence logic),
  then Level 1–0 (substrate and primal loop).

The role of EFD is to provide the *top-down* map that makes sense of
what we infer bottom-up.
