EFD FOUNDATIONS v3.8 — MATHEMATICAL CORE (ASCII EDITION)
========================================================

## FRAMEWORK

Base logic     : classical (first-order with sets).
Universe       : a non-empty set P  (Potential).
Difference     : a binary relation Δ ⊆ P × P.

Guard (no tautology / no totals):
(G1) Irreflexive      :  ∀a∈P : (a,a) ∉ Δ
(G2) Non-empty        :  ∃a,b∈P : a≠b ∧ (a,b)∈Δ
(G3) Partial (optional): Δ not assumed complete; symmetry optional.

Optional add-ons (not used by core theorems):

* Symmetry   :  (a,b)∈Δ ⇒ (b,a)∈Δ
* AFA (Aczel): for circular denotations if desired
* LP (Priest): for paraconsistent variants (re-prove where needed)

---

0. PRIMITIVES

---

Interpret “a differs from b” as atom:
diff(a,b)  :⇔  (a,b) ∈ Δ

No metric, order, or time is assumed.

---

1. INDIRECT DIFFERENCE (INDUCTIVE STEP)

---

Define path-composition operator F on relations X ⊆ P×P:

F(X) := { (a,b) | a≠b ∧ ∃c∈P : (a,c)∈X ∧ (c,b)∈X }

F is monotone:  X⊆Y ⇒ F(X)⊆F(Y).

---

2. FEEDBACK / TRANSITIVE CLOSURE (TRUE CLOSURE OPERATOR)

---

Define μ : P(P×P) → P(P×P) by

μ(R) := R ∪ F(R) ∪ F(F(R)) ∪ F^3(R) ∪ ...   (irreflexive paths)

Then μ is a closure operator on the complete lattice (P(P×P),⊆):

* Extensive   :   R ⊆ μ(R)
* Monotone    :   R₁⊆R₂ ⇒ μ(R₁)⊆μ(R₂)
* Idempotent  :   μ(μ(R)) = μ(R)

Intuition: μ(R) = all pairs connected by a finite Δ-path (length ≥1),
with (a,a) pairs excluded by (G1).

---

3. COHERENCE (CONSISTENCY PRESSURE, STRUCTURAL)

---

Let Σ be a finite set of local “state labels” and
let ρ be a rule-schema that assigns states to edges:

σ_R : μ(R) → Σ    subject to ρ  (determined by local constraints)

Define structural contradiction (within the same rule-set ρ):
Contradict(a,b) :⇔  ∃incompatible s,t∈Σ :
σ_R(a,b)=s ∧ σ_R(a,b)=t

Define the coherence filter κ on relations:
κ(R) := { (a,b) ∈ μ(R) | ¬Contradict(a,b) }.

Monotonicity (under fixed ρ):
R₁⊆R₂  ⇒  μ(R₁)⊆μ(R₂)  ⇒  κ(R₁)⊆κ(R₂).

Remarks:

* In classical logic, set-membership contradictions do not occur;
  “Contradict” refers to rule-incompatibility under ρ (not A∈/∉).
* If you adopt paraconsistency (LP), re-check monotonicity proofs.

---

4. LOGICAL SUBSTRATE (LATTICE)

---

Let S := ( P(μ(Δ)), ⊆ ).  S is a complete lattice (powerset by inclusion).
All subsequent operators act on S.

---

5. PERSISTENCE (FIXED POINTS OF FEEDBACK + COHERENCE)

---

Define the combined self-map Φ on S:

Φ(R) := κ( R ∪ F(R) )   or equivalently   Φ(R) := κ( μ(R) )

Φ is monotone on S (given fixed ρ, Σ).

By Knaster–Tarski (complete lattice + monotone self-map):
Fix(Φ) ≔ { R ∈ S | Φ(R) = R }  is non-empty and forms a complete lattice.

Interpretation:
Persistent configurations = relations closed under feedback (μ)
and consistent under the rule-schema (κ).

Non-triviality conditions (to avoid only ∅ or μ(Δ)):

* Δ neither empty nor complete; and
* ρ, Σ induce selective κ (some edges filtered / some retained);
  ⇒ intermediate fixed points exist (empirically verifiable).

---

6. DENSE SUB-CONTEXTS (OPTIONAL, WELL-DEFINED VERSION)

---

For finite or filtered subsupports U⊆P, define local density:

dens_U(R) := | R ∩ (U×U) |  /  max(1, |U|·(|U|-1))

Pick maximizers over a cover {U_i} to get “contexts”:
Contexts(R) := argmax_U dens_U(R)

(Use any consistent filtration; not needed for core theorems.)

---

7. SUMMARY OF CLAIMS (FORMAL CORE)

---

* Δ: primitive, irreflexive, non-empty, not total (G1–G3).
* μ: transitive-closure operator (extensive, monotone, idempotent).
* κ: rule-consistency filter (monotone under fixed ρ).
* Φ := κ∘μ is monotone on complete lattice S.
* Therefore Fix(Φ) ≠ ∅ (persistent, coherent configurations exist).
* These fixed points correspond to “timeless” stable patterns:
  invariants of (feedback + coherence), not of temporal evolution.

8. UPDATED INTERPRETATION MAP (ALIGNS WITH v4.0 CLEANROOM)

---

P            → Ω (Pure Possibility / Potential)
Δ            → primitive Difference
F            → indirect‑difference step (one hop of co‑reference)
μ            → Feedback/closure of difference (all finite Δ‑paths; no time)
κ (ρ,Σ)     → Consistency pressure (rule‑based coherence filter)
Φ=κ∘μ       → Coherent‑feedback operator
Fix(Φ)      → Persistent configurations (timeless stable patterns)

S=P(μ(Δ))   → Space of admissible relations (complete lattice of views)
{dens_U, Contexts(R)}
→ Provisional “contexts” (local coherence concentrations / coarse‑grain views)

New identifications (bridging to v4.0):
M           → any maximally coherent region selected from Fix(Φ)
L ⊆ M       → feedback loop (subset that reinstates its own constraints)
M_L         → minimal coherence **closure** of a persistent loop/cluster L
∂M (or ∂M_L)→ boundary: admissible‑but‑incompatible extensions (relative to M or M_L)
Noise       → **boundary non‑invariance** (which admissible extensions can be included depends on context/overlap)

Coupling    → **static** joint satisfiability: loops share distinctions or mediator constraints ⇒ require a common coherent assignment (no time needed)

B ⊂ ∂M_L    → finite **blanket/interface** of a loop‑cluster to its boundary
Time (induced)
→ internal order of self‑recoherences inside a persistent loop/cluster (not in Ω)
Laws        → protected invariants (symmetries/conservation‑like constraints that survive boundary flicker across B)

Observers   → persistent loop‑clusters L with finite blanket B inside M_L
Universe    → intersection of invariants stabilized across many observers (maximal shared persistence)

One‑liner:
Existence = Persistent Difference; Observation = Persistent Loop‑Closure with a Finite Boundary Interface; Noise = Boundary Non‑Invariance. ∎
