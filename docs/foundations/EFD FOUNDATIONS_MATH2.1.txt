TITLE: EFD FOUNDATIONS — MATHEMATICAL CORE v2.1 (aligned to primal loop)

0. FRAMEWORK
Base logic     : classical (first-order with sets)
Universe       : P defined as the minimal self-consistent closure of difference
Difference     : Δ ⊆ P × P, forced by (∅ ↔ ∃)

Comment:
Earlier versions assumed “a non-empty set P”. Here non-emptiness is DERIVED
from the primal loop (nothing ↔ something), which forces a nontrivial Δ.

1. PRIMITIVES
We take as primitive:
    (i) the primal mutual-definition loop (∅ ↔ ∃)
    (ii) the existence of a nontrivial difference operator Δ
From (i) we get that “absence” and “presence” co-arise.
From (ii) we can state Δ(a,b) ⇔ a ≠ b.

2. DERIVED NON-EMPTINESS
(G2) Non-empty (derived):
    from (∅ ↔ ∃) we obtain ∃a,b ∈ P : a ≠ b and (a,b) ∈ Δ
so P is not assumed non-empty; it is non-empty because mutual definition is impossible
without at least two distinguishables.

3. GUARDS
(G1) Irreflexive      : ∀a ∈ P : (a,a) ∉ Δ
(G2) Non-empty (der.) : ∃a,b ∈ P : a ≠ b ∧ (a,b) ∈ Δ
(G3) Partial allowed  : Δ need not be total on P

3.1 BASE DIFFERENCE
To bind the logical primal loop (∅ ↔ ∃) to the mathematical construction,
we take as initial pair:
    let a := ∅
    let b := ∃
and define the base relation
    Δ¹ := { (a, b) }
All higher-order differences are generated from this base.

4. CLOSURE CONSTRUCTION
Define:
    Δ¹ := Δ
    Δ² := { ((x1,x2),(y1,y2)) | (x1,x2)∈Δ ∧ (y1,y2)∈Δ ∧ (x1,x2) ≠ (y1,y2) }
In general:
    Δⁿ⁺¹ := { (u,v) | u∈Δⁿ, v∈Δⁿ, u ≠ v }
Then define the substrate:
    Ω := ⋃_{n≥1} Δⁿ
This is the mathematical counterpart of “closure of difference”.

5. STATIC SUBSTRATE
By definition Ω is a completed object:
    Ω is not built in time
    Ω is the set/class obtained by closing Δ under itself
This matches the ontology: static totality, internally traversed.

6. MANIFEST SLICE
Let M ⊆ Ω be any subcollection that is closed under the coherence rules
defined for the physical/observable layer (to be defined in later docs).
Then “time” is an order on M induced by its traversal:
    t : M → ℕ (or any well-order) such that coherence increases with t.

7. BOUNDARY AND NOISE
Let Coherent(M) be the set of fully reconciled elements.
Define:
    ∂M := Ω \ Coherent(M)  intersect  N(M)
where N(M) is the neighborhood (touching) of M in Ω.
Noise η is the measure/indicator of non-reconciliation at ∂M.
Neighborhood N(M) is understood in the Δ-sense: elements directly
related to M by the difference relation. No additional metric or
topology is assumed.

8. STABLE LOOPS (FIXED POINTS)
A structure L ⊆ Ω is a stable feedback loop iff
    Δ(L) ≈ L
(≈: equal modulo boundary terms carrying η)
(≈ meaning equality up to the permitted equivalence in the model).
These subsets will later be interpreted as laws/fields/metrics.
