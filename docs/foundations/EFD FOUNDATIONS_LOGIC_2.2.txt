TITLE: EFD FOUNDATIONS v4.0 — LINGUISTIC CLEANROOM
PIPELINE: (∅ ↔ ∃) → Δ → closure → Ω → M → ∂M → Noise

0. MOTIVATION
We want an ontology that does not assume “something” is already there.
We start from a mutual-definition loop:
    nothing ↔ something
Neither side is primitive. Each is only meaningful by contrast with the other.
That contrast is the origin of DIFFERENCE (Δ).
From closure of Δ we get Ω (the total static field of all self-consistent differences).
Manifest reality (the world we experience) is a traversal of Ω.

1. PRIMAL LOOP
Definition:
    PRIMAL LOOP := (nothing ↔ something)
Properties:
    - non-sequential: no “first”
    - relational: neither term exists without the other
    - self-referential: the loop defines the condition for definition itself
Consequence:
    The loop forces at least one nontrivial distinction.

2. DIFFERENCE (Δ)
Once the loop is present, difference is forced:
    Δ(a,b)  ⇔  a ≠ b
This is the minimal act of distinction.
By stating that a and b differ, we commit to the existence of a and b as referents.
So existence here is not “substance” but “referential availability.”

3. CLOSURE OF DIFFERENCE
Difference is not a one-off. If Δ is a rule, it can be applied to its own products.
    Δ → Δ² → Δ³ → …
This recursive closure is logically forced: if a difference can be made, a difference
between differences can be made. There is no upper bound on depth.

4. SUBSTRATE (Ω)
Ω := the static, timeless, complete set of all self-consistent differences obtained
by closing Δ under itself.
Important:
    - Ω is not assumed.
    - Ω is derived from the primal loop via Δ and closure.
    - Ω is “there” as a logical object, not as temporal accumulation.
Thus:
    (∅ ↔ ∃) → Δ → closure → Ω

5. MANIFEST LAYER (M)
M ⊆ Ω
M is a coherent, locally consistent traversal of Ω.
Selection of M is domain-level (e.g. physical) and not ontology-level:
the ontology only guarantees Ω; choosing which coherent slice to work
with belongs to the later EFD layers (onset_of_dynamics, physics).
From inside M, recursion appears as:
    - update
    - time
    - causality
But these are internal views of movement through a static Ω.

6. BOUNDARY (∂M)
Because Δ is applied recursively, some regions are fully coherent with M and some
are not yet reconciled.
Define:
    ∂M := { x ∈ Ω | x touches M but is not fully coherent with M }
This is the natural place where multiple distinctions intersect and cannot all be
flattened at once.

7. NOISE (η)
Self-reference is never perfectly exact: representation ≠ represented.
The residual mismatch at ∂M is noise:
    η := unresolved Δ at the boundary
Noise is not an external disturbance; it is the local remainder of self-reference.
η ≠ 0 keeps the system from collapsing into a tautology and drives apparent dynamics.

8. STABLE FEEDBACK LOOPS
Within Ω, some configurations satisfy:
    L ≈ Δ(L)
Here “≈” means equality up to boundary differences, i.e. two loop
structures are considered the same if they differ only on ∂M where
noise (η) resides.
These are stable feedback loops.
From inside them, they look like:
    - laws
    - metric/space
    - ordered change/time
    - persistent asymmetry/energy-matter

9. SUMMARY
Ontology is:
    primal loop
    → difference
    → recursive closure
    → static substrate (Ω)
    → manifest traversal (M)
    → boundary (∂M)
    → noise (η)
    → stable loops (emergent physics)
This removes the earlier hidden assumption “start from non-empty Ω”.
