EFD FOUNDATIONS v4.0 — LINGUISTIC CLEANROOM (Ω→M→∂M→Noise)
==========================================================

0. PREMISE — PURE POSSIBILITY AND DIFFERENCE

---

Before any definable thing exists, there is only Ω — PURE POSSIBILITY:
openness where distinctions are admissible, with no claim that all are
instantiated. Ω is not a field or process; it has no time or measure.

DIFFERENCE is the first fact within that openness: something can be
not identical to something else.

---

1. NECESSITY OF DIFFERENCE

---

Within unbounded possibility, “no difference” is a singular configuration
with zero logical measure among admissible configurations. Therefore,
difference is logically inevitable — not an event but a consequence of
possibility itself.

---

2. DIFFERENCE AS PRIMITIVE

---

Difference (Δ) is irreducible. It is not caused or derived; it is the
relation that makes relations possible.

Ω and Δ are complementary:
Ω permits distinctions; Δ gives them content.

---

3. DISTINCTION — DIFFERENCE REFERENCING DIFFERENCE

---

Each Difference implies at least two distinguishable aspects. When
differences reference one another, a web of distinctions arises — a
co‑inductive totality where parts are defined only through contrast.
No base element exists; all definitions are mutual.

---

4. RELATIONAL CONTEXT

---

All distinctions coexist within Ω as one relational backdrop. Meaning
arises only through relation; isolation has no definition. Local
concentrations of mutually supporting differences form provisional
contexts inside the whole.

*Coarse‑graining (partial views) induces effective constraints that may be
mutually incompatible, shifting which relations are pushed to ∂M; this is
perceived as flicker from within a partial context.*

---

5. CONSISTENCY PRESSURE

---

Some relational combinations contradict — defining the same distinction
as both identical and non‑identical. Such contradictions cannot sustain
mutual reference and drop out. Consistency acts as logical pressure,
favoring stable connectivity.

---

6. LOGICAL SUBSTRATE — M (MAXIMALLY COHERENT REGION)

---

From Ω, select a maximally coherent region M: within M, local differences
cohere; adding anything further (still admissible in Ω) would break that
coherence. M can be infinite in extent yet is coherence‑bounded.
It is not equilibrium in time but timeless coherence.

---

7. SELF‑REFERENCE AND FEEDBACK

---

Within M, relations may reference their own configurations. This
reflexivity is FEEDBACK — a structural self‑relation, not a temporal
loop. Feedback expresses M’s capacity to evaluate and sustain its own
coherence.

---

7.1 LOOP CLOSURE (L ⇒ M_L)

---

Any persistent feedback loop L induces its *minimal coherence closure*
M_L: the smallest region that contains whatever relations L requires to
remain self‑consistent under its own checks. Boundaries and noise are
always understood relative to such a coherent region.

---

8. PERSISTENCE

---

When recursive relations remain coherent under all internal reference,
a PERSISTENT CONFIGURATION arises — a pattern retaining identity under
self‑consistency. Persistence is invariance under coherence, not duration
in time.

---

NOISE — BOUNDARY NON‑INVARIANCE (ATEMPORAL)

---

For any coherent region M (including a loop’s closure M_L), define the
boundary ∂M as the interface where additions admissible in Ω would break
M’s coherence. Noise is NON‑INVARIANCE at ∂M: alternative, mutually
incompatible local resolutions permitted by Ω that M cannot accommodate
simultaneously while remaining coherent.

This is not randomness and not temporal change. It follows from:
• maximal coherence of M (interior stability), and
• contact with Ω at ∂M (admissible but incompatible extensions).

From an internal viewpoint this presents as “flicker”: inclusion/exclusion
of particular relations across overlapping coherent views touching ∂M of
the same timeless whole.

*Noise emerges from Ω, Δ, and maximal coherence alone — no extra primitives.*

---

COUPLING (STATIC) — JOINT COHERENCE WITHOUT TIME

---

Coupling is a **static** property. Loops couple when their constraints
overlap or are glued by a mediator relation/invariant, so that only
*joint* assignments are coherent. No process is required — coupling is
simultaneous satisfiability in the shared closure.

Given loops {L_i}, their joint persistence selects a shared closure M_L:

a maximally coherent envelope that supports all L_i together and excludes
admissible but incompatible extensions to its boundary ∂M_L.

---

OBSERVERS — LIMITED INTERFACE, INDUCED TIME, PROTECTED LAWS

---

An **observer** is a persistent loop‑cluster L with a **finite interface**
(“blanket”) B ⊂ ∂M_L. Its internal self‑checks impose an order on
re‑coherences experienced as **time** (internal to L, not in Ω). To remain
stable against boundary flicker across B, the cluster locks onto
**protected invariants** — its effective **laws**. Objectivity arises as
the intersection of invariants stabilized by many overlapping observers.

---
