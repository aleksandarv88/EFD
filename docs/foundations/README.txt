CHAPTER: FOUNDATIONS

This chapter defines the core ontology and mathematics of EFD:

  - how "something" arises from (nothing ↔ possibility)
  - how difference (Δ) generates a substrate (Ω)
  - how Ω is interpreted as the superposition of all possibilities
  - how manifest reality (M), boundary (∂M), noise (η),
    and stable feedback loops are defined
  - how emergence selects which structures persist

DOCUMENTS
======================================================

1. EFD_HIERARCHY_1.0.txt
   - Global map of EFD levels:
       Level 0: Logic
       Level 1: Substrate
       Level 2: Emergence
       Level 3: Proto-physics
       Level 4: Physics
       Level 5: Mind
   - Read this first for orientation.

2. EFD_FOUNDATIONS_LOGIC_2.3.txt
   - Ontology from:
       (nothing ↔ possibility) → Δ → closure → Ω
   - Definitions of:
       Ω, M, ∂M, η, stable loops
   - Superposition as relational property.

3. EFD_FOUNDATIONS_MATH2.2.txt
   - Formal Δⁿ construction.
   - Definition of Ω as closure.
   - Mathematical view of superposition and stable loops.

4. EFD_EMERGENCE_1.0.txt
   - Emergence functional:
       F(L) = S(L) − λ η(L)
   - Ontological emergence principle:
       high-F loops persist and scaffold higher structure.
   - Physics is an effective, mid-level description of such loops.

(Planned)
5. EFD_PHYSICS_MAP_1.0.txt
   - Will map standard physics (QM, QFT, GR, Newton)
     onto the EFD hierarchy.

SIMULATIONS
======================================================

Currently the foundations chapter is purely conceptual/mathematical.

If/when logic/math experiments are added, they will be under:

  docs/foundations/sims/

with its own README.txt following the standard pattern.
