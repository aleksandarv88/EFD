EFD ONTOLOGY v0.1 (PRIMAL LOOP) — FROZEN VERSION
================================================

1. PRIMAL LOOP
   nothing ↔ something

   * neither precedes the other
   * both co-define through contrast (difference Δ)
   * this is the first self-reference — the origin of ontology

2. DIFFERENCE (Δ)

   * minimal act of distinction
   * Δ(a,b) ⇒ existence of a,b
   * identity = stable repetition of Δ
   * existence = awareness of difference

3. CLOSURE

   * Δ applies to its own outputs
   * Δ → Δ² → Δ³ → … (recursive closure)
   * no external allowance; closure is logically forced
   * recursion defines the total field of possibilities

4. SUBSTRATE (Ω)

   * total static set of all self-consistent differences
   * timeless and complete — all possible relations coexist
   * recursion closure of Δ forms Ω instantly (no time process)
   * perceived dynamics arise from internal traversal of Ω

5. MANIFEST LAYER (M)

   * local coherent region of Ω
   * traversal of Ω appears as time, computation, and causality
   * internal order of updates = perceived temporal flow
   * boundaries of coherence define ∂M

6. BOUNDARIES (∂M)

   * emerge where multiple differences intersect or conflict
   * represent transition zones between coherent regions
   * formalized as the interface of resolved ↔ unresolved Δ
   * ∂M = { x ∈ Ω | x touches M but not fully coherent with M }

7. NOISE (η)

   * inevitable mismatch at self-reference boundary
   * η = residual difference that cannot resolve to exact inversion
   * drives change, diversity, and apparent randomness
   * existence requires η ≠ 0 (perfect symmetry collapses distinction)

8. STABLE FEEDBACK LOOPS (Λ)

   * self-consistent substructures: Λ ≈ Δ(Λ)
   * represent regions of recursive stability within Ω
   * produce emergent utilities: space, time, energy, and matter
   * each Λ is both autonomous and coupled within the global Ω

9. GLOBAL STRUCTURE

   * one primal loop at root (nothing ↔ something)
   * countless interlocking loops within Ω (Λ₁, Λ₂, …)
   * their mutual interference generates the richness of reality

10. ONTOLOGICAL SUMMARY
    loop → difference → closure → substrate → boundary → noise → feedback
    Each step forced by the logic of self-reference;
    together they constitute the static yet living totality of existence.
