EFD: Onset of Dynamics

This is the stage where a static, maximally coherent structure (your v4.0) starts to look like a world with signals, time, geometry, matter, and forces.

1. Starting point

There is a substrate of admissible differences (Ω).

Consistency pressure selects a maximally coherent region M.

M has a boundary ∂M where multiple admissible but incompatible extensions exist (noise = boundary non-invariance).

Inside M, some relations reference themselves and stay coherent: feedback loops L.

Any loop (or cluster of loops) induces its minimal coherence closure Mₗ.

Coupling glues several loops into a joint closure when they share constraints.

An observer is such a loop-cluster with a finite interface to its boundary.

This is all from your existing EFD.

2. Emergent sequence (internal time)

A loop-cluster cannot satisfy all boundary choices at once.

Therefore it must re-apply its coherence checks in an order.

This ordered re-coherence is the sequence for that cluster.

Call this sequence the observer’s time.

Time is thus internal to the cluster, not global in Ω.

3. Emergent causal structure

A change at one interface element can require a re-coherence at another.

If re-coherence at A is always performed before re-coherence at B, then A can influence B in that sequence.

Define A → B (A precedes B) if B’s coherent assignment depends on A’s assignment within the cluster’s sequence.

The set of such precedences inside Mₗ is the causal structure for that loop-cluster.

Causality here = “must be settled first so the other can be settled.”

4. Emergent speed limit (c)

Re-coherence does not happen everywhere at once; it propagates along the relations that define Mₗ.

There is a shortest possible number of steps (or smallest coherence cost) for a change at point X to become required at point Y.

This gives a minimum re-coherence time per unit “hop” in the structure.

The inverse of this minimum is the maximum propagation rate of constraint changes.

Call this maximum rate c for that observer.

c is not imposed from outside; it is fixed by the structure of Mₗ and its update rule.

5. Paths and effective metric

Between two interface points, there can be several re-coherence routes.

Each route has a total coherence cost (or total number of ordered steps).

The route with minimal cost is the effective straight path between those points.

Define the “distance” between two points as the minimal cost of re-coherence between them.

This makes distance an emergent property of the coherence structure, not a background assumption.

Collections of such distances give an effective metric for the observer.

6. Curvature (holonomy of re-coherence)

Consider re-cohering around a small closed cycle in Mₗ.

If after completing the cycle the assignments are not exactly what they were before, there is mismatch.

This mismatch comes from overlaps of constraints and is the holonomy of the cycle.

Non-zero holonomy means the effective metric is not globally flat: there is curvature.

Thus curvature here = “re-coherence around a loop does not return you to the same assignment.”

7. Coherence cost and energy

Every persistent loop or cluster must keep certain assignments even against boundary flicker.

Keeping these assignments has a non-zero coherence cost.

This stable, required cost is the loop’s rest energy.

Because the underlying rule is the same everywhere in Mₗ, the total coherence cost is conserved under internal re-coherence.

That conservation is the EFD version of energy conservation.

8. Mass as tied rest energy

There is already a maximum propagation rate c in the structure.

A loop-cluster with rest energy E₀ can be assigned an inertial measure by comparing E₀ to c.

Define mass m = E₀ / c².

This is not imported from physics; it is a way to normalize “how hard it is to keep this loop coherent” against the fabric’s fastest possible influence.

Moving such a cluster through the structure requires extra coherence to keep all its constraints aligned in sequence → energy rises.

That gives the EFD version of E = m c².

9. Forces as coherence gradients

Different regions of Mₗ can have different coherence costs for the same loop.

A loop-cluster tends to shift toward regions where it can maintain coherence with lower cost.

This preference produces effective motion.

Motion toward lower coherence cost is what we call a force.

So forces are not extra primitives; they are responses to coherence gradients.

10. Constants from shared invariants

Different observers are different loop-clusters.

What looks the same to all of them are the invariants that survive all of their re-coherence procedures.

Those common invariants appear as constants (c, possibly coupling strengths).

Thus constants are “what every viable observer must preserve to stay coherent,” not arbitrary numbers.

11. Singularity avoidance

M and every Mₗ are coherence-bounded: adding more relations than allowed breaks coherence.

Feedback loops also have a minimal closure size.

Therefore, coherence costs and effective curvature cannot run to infinity inside the model.

When pressure grows, the structure enlarges the closure or changes local resolutions, instead of diverging.

That is the EFD version of “no singularities.”
