EFD: ONSET OF DYNAMICS — RIGOROUS MATH ROADMAP (v2)
===================================================

## PURPOSE

This roadmap defines the mathematical steps required to rigorously derive, formalize, and test the principles in **EFD: Onset of Dynamics**. It refines previous versions by addressing feedback-loop cycles (Stage 3) and discrete-to-continuum curvature transitions (Stage 5).

---

## STAGE 1 — FORMAL SUBSTRATE DEFINITIONS

### Goal

Define Ω, M, and ∂M rigorously in mathematical terms.

### Tasks

1. **Define Ω (Substrate):**
   Represent Ω as a set of admissible relations/differences:
   Ω ⊂ P(V × V), where V is a vertex set.
   Each element (a,b,Δ) encodes a primitive difference relation.

2. **Define Consistency Pressure:**
   Introduce a coherence functional C(R): Ω → ℝ that measures logical consistency.
   M = argmax_R C(R).
   Prove existence, boundedness, and local uniqueness of M.

3. **Define Boundary (∂M):**
   ∂M = { r ∈ Ω | r ∉ M but coherent with some subgraph of M }.
   Show that boundary elements correspond to admissible but incompatible extensions (noise sources).

---

## STAGE 2 — LOOP STRUCTURE AND CLOSURE

### Goal

Formally construct feedback loops and their coherence closures.

### Tasks

1. **Define Feedback Loop L:**
   L = (x₁ → x₂ → ... → x₁), a closed sequence of relations preserving internal consistency.

2. **Define Minimal Coherence Closure (Mₗ):**
   Mₗ = smallest subset of M that ensures L remains self-consistent.
   Prove Mₗ ⊂ M and ∂Mₗ ⊂ ∂M.

3. **Define Coupling Between Loops:**
   For loops Lᵢ, Lⱼ define joint closure M_{ij} = Mₗᵢ ∪ Mₗⱼ if coherent.
   Prove that transitive coupling preserves coherence (closure of closures property).

---

## STAGE 3 — RE-COHERENCE ORDER AND INTERNAL TIME

### Goal

Define ordered re-coherence and show that a causal sequence (time) emerges without paradoxes.

### Tasks

1. **Define Re-Coherence Operator R:**
   R: M → M updates local assignments to restore coherence.

2. **Address Feedback Loops (Cycles):**
   The coherence graph G = (V,E) may contain cycles. Decompose G into **strongly connected components (SCCs)**.
   Each SCC represents a simultaneous feedback block (loop cluster).

3. **Define Partial Order of SCCs:**
   Construct the condensation graph G′ = SCC(G).
   G′ is acyclic; define A < B if SCC_A must re-cohere before SCC_B.
   This ensures time order emerges over an acyclic projection.

4. **Define Observer Time:**
   τ = sequence length of ordered re-coherences over G′.
   Prove τ is invariant under internal relabeling of the observer’s closure Mₗ.

---

## STAGE 4 — PROPAGATION AND SPEED LIMIT (c)

### Goal

Quantify propagation of coherence and derive the invariant speed limit c.

### Tasks

1. **Define Propagation Cost:**
   c(A,B) = minimal number of re-coherence steps needed for change at A to affect B.

2. **Define Minimum Update Interval:**
   There exists Δt_min such that no re-coherence can occur faster than Δt_min.

3. **Derive c:**
   c = 1 / Δt_min.
   Prove invariance of c under isomorphic remapping of Mₗ.

---

## STAGE 5 — METRIC AND CURVATURE FROM COHERENCE

### Goal

Define effective metric and curvature in discrete and continuous formulations.

### Tasks

1. **Discrete Metric Definition:**
   Define d(A,B) = min_{paths γ} ∑_{e∈γ} w(e), where w(e) = local coherence cost.
   Show that d(A,B) satisfies metric properties (positivity, symmetry, triangle inequality).

2. **Discrete Curvature Definition:**
   Define holonomy around loop γ:
   𝓗(γ) = 1 - ∏_{e∈γ} R(e), where R(e) is local re-coherence rotation.
   Alternatively, apply **Ollivier-Ricci** or **Forman curvature** as discrete analogues.

3. **Continuum Limit:**
   In large-graph limit |V| → ∞, define smooth field approximation:
   g_{ij} = f(∂²C/∂x_i∂x_j).
   Show that local curvature from 𝓗(γ) converges to Riemann curvature tensor form.

---

## STAGE 6 — COHERENCE COST AND ENERGY CONSERVATION

### Goal

Define energy as coherence cost and prove its conservation under re-coherence.

### Tasks

1. **Local Coherence Cost Functional:**
   E(x) = ∑ |ΔC(x)|² over updates.

2. **Conservation Law:**
   Show that ∂E/∂τ = 0 under valid re-coherence.
   Interpret as internal energy conservation.

3. **Observer Invariance:**
   Prove that E_total = const within each Mₗ, independent of observer position.

---

## STAGE 7 — NUMERICAL VALIDATION

### Goal

Simulate discrete coherence graphs to confirm theoretical behavior.

### Tasks

1. Build graph model of distinctions (nodes) and coherence dependencies (edges).
2. Implement iterative re-coherence dynamics respecting SCC-based update order.
3. Measure emergent c, distances, curvature, and verify ∂E/∂τ = 0 numerically.

---

## OUTCOME

Upon completion, this roadmap will yield:

* Formal definitions of Ω, M, ∂M, and Mₗ.
* Rigorous proofs of order emergence and causal acyclicity.
* Discrete-to-continuum mapping for metric and curvature.
* Conservation of coherence cost as the foundation for energy.
* Simulation confirmation of emergent dynamics.

Next step: **EFD: Emergent Physical Structures — Mathematical Layer**.
