EFD MATHEMATICAL ROADMAP — FORMAL FOUNDATIONS AND PROOFS
========================================================

## PURPOSE

To establish a rigorous mathematical structure for the EFD (Emergent Feedback Dynamics) framework, proving each conceptual stage in the development roadmap with explicit formalism. This roadmap outlines *what* must be defined, *what must be proven*, and *which mathematical tools* are required to legitimize EFD as a self-consistent physical theory.

## 1. LOGICAL AND SET-THEORETIC FOUNDATION

**Goal:** Prove the formal consistency of the EFD substrate (Ω, Δ, M, ∂M, Noise).

**Requirements:**

* Formalize Ω as a set or class of admissible configurations.
* Define Δ as a primitive irreflexive binary relation (difference operator).
* Prove closure and monotonicity of μ (feedback operator) and κ (coherence filter).
* Use fixed-point theorems (Knaster–Tarski) to show existence of persistent configurations.

**Tools:**

* Set theory, lattice theory, category theory (for relational mappings).
* Model theory (consistency and completeness within logical substrate).

**Proof Objectives:**

* Prove Fix(Φ) ≠ ∅ (existence of persistent coherent configurations).
* Show that feedback + coherence implies structural persistence without invoking time.
