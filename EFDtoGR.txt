κ translates to the variational principle that the integral of the line element

rac{d^2 x^lpha}{d\lambda^2} + \Gamma^lpha_{\mu

where 
𝜆
λ is an affine parameter and \Gamma^lpha_{\mu u}= frac{1}{2}g^{lphaeta}(\partial_\mu g_{eta u}+\partial_ u g_{eta\mu}-\partial_eta g_{\mu u}) are the Christoffel symbols. Thus, free fall corresponds to minimal‑feedback paths in

). In a coordinate chart, the parallel transport of a vector 
𝑣

	​

 is the Riemann curvature tensor and 
𝜎
ℎ
𝑜
𝜎
σ

 is the area spanned by the loop. In the EFD picture, curvature arises because composition of differences is not globally commutative: the order of composition matters, leading to non‑zero holonomy. The Bianchi identities for the curvature tensor correspond to coherence conditions: the sum of holonomies around adjacent loops must vanish to maintain consistency. This is analogous to the fact that 
𝜇
μ is idempotent and 
𝜅
κ filters contradictions.

2.3 Einstein’s field equations from a consistency condition

Let the state label

 assign to each difference not only lengths but also energy–momentum information via a stress–energy tensor

. The coherence filter

3 Singularity formation and EFD boundaries
3.1 Classical singularities

In general relativity, singularities appear when curvature invariants (e.g., the Kretschmann scalar 
𝑅
𝜇
𝑢
ℎ
𝑜
𝜎
𝑅
𝜇
𝑢
ℎ
𝑜
𝜎

μuhoσ
) diverge and geodesics cannot be extended. Penrose’s theorem states that under the null energy condition and global hyperbolicity, the existence of an outer‑trapped surface implies geodesic incompleteness
arxiv.org
. Physically, this occurs in gravitational collapse and at the Big Bang.

In EFD, a singularity corresponds to a region where the feedback closure cannot be consistently extended—i.e., a boundary 
∂
𝑀
∂M of maximal coherence. Beyond 
∂
𝑀
∂M, admissible relations would violate the coherence constraints, producing “noise.” Thus, singularities in classical GR are manifestations of the failure of relational coherence at extreme density. To avoid singularities, one must either alter the relational rules near 
∂
𝑀
∂M or limit the density of differences.

3.2 Fundamental length and irreducible difference

The EFD framework assumes that the primitive relation 
Δ
Δ is irreducible and there is always a minimal difference. This is analogous to a fundamental length scale 
ℓ
ℓ in quantum gravity. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle implies that a mass cannot be localised to an exact point; thus a singularity of zero size and infinite density is forbidden
phys.org
. Enforcing a minimum loop area in the feedback network caps curvature. Let 
ℓ
ℓ be the smallest loop area; then the curvature two‑form 
𝑅
R satisfies 
∣
𝑅
∣
≲
ℓ
−
2
∣R∣≲ℓ
−2
. This provides a bound on curvature invariants and prevents singularity formation.

4 Modifications of Einstein’s equations to remove singularities

While the relational viewpoint provides conceptual reasons to avoid singularities, explicit modifications to the Einstein equations are needed in a field‑theoretic description. Recent research shows that higher‑order curvature terms or non‑polynomial corrections can eliminate singularities and yield regular black holes without exotic matter.

4.1 Infinite series of higher‑order terms

A 2025 study by Cano, Hennigar and collaborators demonstrated that an infinite series of higher‑order gravitational corrections—terms quadratic, cubic and so on in curvature—can eliminate black‑hole singularities
phys.org
. In an effective action the modified Lagrangian density has the schematic form

\mathcal{L} = rac{1}{16\pi G} \Big( R + \sum_{n=2}^\infty lpha_n \ell^{2n-2} \mathcal{I}_n(R_{\mu u ho\sigma}) \Big),

where 
𝐼
𝑛
I
n
	​

 are scalar invariants built from contractions of 
𝑛
n Riemann tensors (e.g., 
𝑅

𝑅
𝜇

, etc.), and 
ℓ
ℓ is a length scale, possibly related to the Planck length. The coefficients lpha_n are determined by the underlying quantum theory. When one solves the resulting field equations for a spherically symmetric, static spacetime, the curvature invariants remain finite, and the central singularity of the Schwarzschild solution is replaced by a highly curved but regular region
livescience.com
.

In EFD terms, the higher‑order terms correspond to longer feedback loops and more intricate path compositions. The coherence filter 
𝜅
κ must allow for these additional relational constraints near the core of a black hole. As 
ℓ
𝑜
0
ℓo0 the theory reduces to classical GR; for finite 
ℓ
ℓ, the corrections become significant at high densities and smooth the geometry.

4.2 Unimodular gravity and white‐hole transitions

Another modification arises from unimodular gravity, where the determinant of the metric is fixed (|g|=1). A 2025 study showed that requiring quantum unitarity in a natural time coordinate resolves the black‑hole singularity, replacing it with a region of large quantum fluctuations; this region transitions to a white hole that expels matter
phys.org
. Time in this model is measured by dark energy, and the singularity is replaced by a quantum region with finite curvature
phys.org
. In the EFD picture, such a transition corresponds to crossing the boundary 
∂
𝑀
∂M into another coherent region, with a different relational order.

4.3 Loop quantum gravity and Planck stars

Loop quantum gravity (LQG) quantises geometry by assigning discrete holonomies to loops. According to a Nature Research Intelligence summary, quantum geometric corrections in LQG can eliminate conventional black‑hole and white‑hole horizons by replacing them with smooth transition surfaces across which curvature invariants remain finite
nature.com
. In the interior, the classical singularity is replaced by a Planck star—a region where quantum pressure halts collapse. The causal structure undergoes a signature change, and the black hole may tunnel to a white hole. In EFD, these quantum loops correspond to elementary difference loops; the minimal loop area provides the fundamental length 
ℓ
ℓ.

4.4 Regular black hole models: the Hayward metric

A concrete singularity‑free solution within classical GR involves modifying the energy–momentum distribution. The Hayward black hole introduces a length scale 
𝑙
l and replaces the central singularity by a de Sitter core. In terms of a dimensionless radial variable 
𝑦
=
𝑟
/
𝑙
y=r/l, the metric function is

F(y) = rac{y^2}{y^3 + 1}\,,

as given in Eq. (51)
iris.unica.it
. The associated energy density and mass function are

\epsilon(r) = rac{3}{4\pi} rac{M l^3}{(r^3 + l^3)^2}, \qquad m(r) = rac{M r^3}{r^3 + l^3},

where 
𝑀
M is the asymptotic mass
iris.unica.it
. When 
𝑙
𝑜
0
lo0, one recovers the Schwarzschild solution; for finite 
𝑙
l the core is regular and has de Sitter behaviour. The mass deviation 
Δ
𝑚
=
𝑀
−
𝑚
(
𝑟
)
Δm=M−m(r) tends to zero at large 
𝑟
r, and the solution is asymptotically flat
iris.unica.it
. The null energy condition holds everywhere, while the strong energy condition is violated only near the core
iris.unica.it
. In the extremal limit the solution develops a throat and approaches an AdS$_2 imes$S$^2$ geometry
iris.unica.it
.

In EFD terms, the presence of a length scale 
𝑙
l means that feedback loops smaller than 
𝑙
l cannot be resolved; the coherence filter 
𝜅
κ therefore smooths the relational structure inside a sphere of radius 
∼
𝑙
∼l. The resulting geometry has a regular centre, and the “noise” across 
∂
𝑀
∂M manifests as a phase transition from Schwarzschild to de Sitter behaviour.

5 Summary

By mapping the primitive difference relation and feedback closure in the EFD foundations to the differential‑geometric structures of general relativity, one can see how space–time, geodesics and curvature emerge from relational patterns. The coherence filter enforces local conservation laws and leads to the Einstein field equations. Singularities in classical GR correspond to the breakdown of relational coherence at the boundary of a maximally coherent region; introducing a fundamental length or modifying the relational rules prevents such breakdowns. Physically, this is realised by adding higher‑order curvature terms to the action
phys.org
, by adopting unimodular or loop‑quantum gravity frameworks
phys.org
nature.com
, or by considering regular classical solutions such as the Hayward metric with a de Sitter core
iris.unica.it
iris.unica.it
. These mathematical modifications smooth the relational network near would‑be singularities and yield geodesically complete spacetimes, consistent with the EFD principle that differences are irreducible and persistent patterns must remain coherent.
